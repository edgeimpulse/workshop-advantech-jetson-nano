# Workshop Advantech Jetson Nano

This tutorial has been designed for the [PERFECTING FACTORY 5.0 WITH EDGE-POWERED AI](https://www.sparkfun.com/perfecting_factory_5_with_edge) workshop in collaboration with Advantech and Sparkfun.

**Tools and Softwares:**

- [Edge Impulse Studio](https://studio.edgeimpulse.com) 
- [Edge Impulse CLI](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/cli-installation) (optional)
- [Balena Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher) to flash the SD card
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to extract frames from a video

**Hardware:**


-  Nvidia [Jetson Nano](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/17244) or Advantech [AIR-020](https://www.advantech.com/products/65f20c25-f6ef-4ab5-be3c-b7dfa7a833b3/air-020/mod_fcf216c8-3495-4809-b815-61dc008d53a4)

- An SD Card (recommended 32 GB UHS-1 card according to Nvidia)
- An ethernet cable (the Jetson Nano doesn't have Wifi)
- An external camera (optional)
- Depending on how you want to setup your Jetson Nano you'll need either a monitor, keyboard and mouse or a DC power supply:
